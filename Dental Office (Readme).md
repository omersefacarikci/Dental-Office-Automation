This Dental Office Automation program is designed to streamline the daily operations of dental clinics, providing a user-friendly solution for managing appointments, 
patient records, treatment plans, and financial transactions efficiently. 

All data is stored in an SQL file included within the project directory, making database setup and configuration straightforward.
To ensure the program functions correctly, the latest version of the .NET Framework must be installed on your computer. 
This requirement is essential for utilizing all the features of the software seamlessly.
As the most recent developer to work on this project, I have meticulously focused on maximizing user experience. 
The software is designed to offer a solution that is both technically robust and well-aligned with user needs.
